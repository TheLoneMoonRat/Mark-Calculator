# Mark Calculator
 
 As a University student, one of my biggest concerns is my marks and how I am performing in school. I frequently make use of the Portal app available for UWaterloo students to track their academics. However, I have come to dislike the UI and general lack of features. As such, I have decided to pursue the task of creating my own grade calculating database.
